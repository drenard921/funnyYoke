A README needs to answer the following what, why, and how:

What was your motivation?
Why did you build this project?
What problem does it solve?
What did you learn?
What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.

How to Writing a Good README file

Here are the steps you should take to write your README.

Include Your Project's Title
This is the name of the project. It describes the whole project in one sentence, and helps people understand what the main goal and aim of the project is.

Write a Description
Your description is an extremely important aspect of your project. A well-crafted description allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.

This is an important component of your project that many new developers often overlook.

The quality of a README desccription often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

What your application does,
Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers who put their work on GitHub.

Add a Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is very long, you might want to add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need. It helps them navigate to different parts of the file.

How to Install Your Project
If your project is software or an app that needs installation, you should include the steps required to install your project. Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

How to Use Your Project
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place of reference.

You can also include screenshots to show examples of the running project.

Include Credits
If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles.

Also, if you followed tutorials to build that particular project, include links to those here as well. This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.

List the License
This is the last section of most README. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use https://choosealicense.com/
